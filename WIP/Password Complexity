#password validator using the re module on Python. Still a WIP.

import re

def validate():
    while True:
        try:
            password = input("Enter a password: ")
            if len(password) < 15:
                print("Make sure your password is at lest 15 letters")
            if re.search('[0-9]',password) is None:
                print("Make sure your password has a number in it")
            if re.search('[A-Z]',password) is None: 
                print("Make sure your password has a capital letter in it")
            if re.search('[a-z]',password) is None:
                print("Make sure your password has a capital letter in it")
            if re.search('[^a-zA-Z0-9]',password) is None:
                print("Make sure your password has a special character in it")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Looking good")
validate()
